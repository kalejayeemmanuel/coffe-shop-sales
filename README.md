## Recommendation

Customer engagement and loyalty

* Focus on building loyalty programs for top customers like Allis Winmore and others in the top 10 list to maintain their engagement and increase their spending. • Consider targeted promotions or discounts for the customers with sales around $204.93 to encourage more frequent purchases and potentially elevate their sales volume.

Country-specific strategies

* The United States accounts for a vast majority of sales since it is already a strong market. Consider scaling marketing efforts here with promotions or new coffee products. • for Ireland and the United Kingdom, which contribute relatively lower percentages invest in targeted advertising or explore local partnerships to boost sales and improve market penetration.

Coffee type optimization

* Although lib and Exc have the highest sales values, Ara has the highest number of orders. This suggests that Ara may have potential for higher revenue if better pricing or bundling strategies are applied. • Consider cross-selling strategies like offering Ara and rob with promotional discounts as they generate lower revenue despite a higher or competitive order quantity.

Inventory and demand forecasting

* Since Ara has the highest order quantity, ensure sufficient inventory to meet customer demand and avoid stockouts. • track customer preferences closely over time to adjust supply levels for coffee types like lib and Exc which have slightly lower order quantities but higher sale
